LTE-A Proximity-based Services, Device-to-device Communication Simulator using NS-3

Under development...

At this point the Network-assited part is functional with UEs able to send by http (from their LTE network interface) discovery requests to the Proximity Function Entity to register for D2D service and be notified of nearby matches. 

Announcing UE can multicast data to its peer, but over wifi-adhoc (instead of wifi-D as supported by the specs).
